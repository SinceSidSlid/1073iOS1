Three Facts About Me
---

*   I am a fan of both Philadelphia and Pittsburgh sports teams, sue me.
*   I'm a pretty big fighting game fan. I treat Evo like its the Super Bowl.
*   I enjoy Settlers of Catan and wish I knew more people that played.

I'm using github, which means that the changes that I make in this file, once I commit and push them, will be visible on the main page of this repo. 

Yep. This is a change.
